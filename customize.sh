Cool, it's time to customize our zsh setup! üòé

A couple of notes before we get started:

1. We'll install some basic stuff now, but whenever you want to update your own configuration, you'll either be
    updating your ~/.zshrc file or the files in ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom

2. Any files (theme.zsh, git_aliases.zsh, etc) that are modified in this script will backup any existing files of the same name first.
    If you want to go back, just delete the file added during this setup, and chage the backup name from some_file.zsh.orig back to some_file.zsh

3. Lots of info about customizing Oh My Zsh can be found on their wiki:
    https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-and-adding-plugins


Alright, let's get started! üî•
